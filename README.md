# News App
a website that fetches news using NewsApi and displays the results to the user. 

Here is a demo of how the website looks .

##Note
Here I have used the developer version of NewsApi.org , so CORS outside of localhost is unable to fetch data , if you want to deploy 
it in production , I recommend buying a Business Acount and replace the API Key in this code accordingly.Then it will work as fine as intended.
